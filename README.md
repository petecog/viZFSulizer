A terminal-based ZFS configuration visualization tool written in Go, providing an interactive way to explore and understand your ZFS setup.

## Why?

This is a hobby project with the following primary aims:

- Give me a small problem on which to work, and develop my sckills using copilot/claude etc in code development,
- Allow me a first foray into application development

Very much secondary is to possibly build a tool that I might find useful. If anyone else finds it useful - this is a bonus, and not my intent.

### Why Go?

Why not, it's a language that I'm aware of but know very little. It might not be the best language for the job, it might not be the easiest language. But it'll probably work... We'll see!

## Features

Current features:

- Interactive Terminal User Interface (TUI) using the Bubble Tea framework
- Development environment using VS Code Dev Containers
- Simulated ZFS environment for testing and development

### Feature Roadmap

1. Pool Structure and Hierarchy
   - [x] Basic TUI framework setup
   - [x] Physical pool structure visualization
   - [x] Device status indicators
   - [ ] VDEV configuration display
     - [ ] Show VDEV types (mirror, raidz1/2/3, spare, cache, log)
     - [ ] Display individual disk properties (size, model, serial)
     - [ ] Show read/write load distribution
     - [ ] Indicate hot spares and their status
     - [ ] Display redundancy levels
     - [ ] Show capacity usage per VDEV
     - [ ] Indicate resilvering progress when active
   - [ ] Interactive navigation

1. - [ ] Change the way that dev examples/tests are provisioned - simple text files
      - [ ] Create a yaml schema
      - [ ] Load examples from yaml files

1. Display / accessibilty
   - [ ] Display modes for accessibility
     - [ ] RGB color mode (default)
     - [ ] Black & White mode (--color=bw) [📝](./.todo/color_mode_implementation.md)
       - Normal borders for ONLINE
       - Dashed borders for DEGRADED (╌╌╌╌)
       - Double-line borders for FAULTED (═══)

1. Testing
   - [ ] Add tests
   - [ ] Add github actions / workflows (or whatever they are called to do tests)

1. Dev mode vs Real mode
   - [ ] Add provision to use real zfs info
   - [ ] Add cli switch to activate 'dev mode' which will use articifial data
   - [ ] Add a simulator to artificial data, which will dynamically change some values on queue or by script.

2. Dataset Properties and Inheritance
   - [ ] Dataset tree visualization
   - [ ] Property display
   - [ ] Inheritance indicators
   - [ ] Property modification tracking

3. Snapshot Relationships
   - [ ] Snapshot timeline visualization
   - [ ] Dependency mapping
   - [ ] Space usage per snapshot
   - [ ] Snapshot comparison tools

4. Performance Metrics
   - [ ] Add simulation, making these things move around, for a dynamic view.
   - [ ] IOPS visualization
   - [ ] Bandwidth metrics
   - [ ] Cache hit/miss rates
   - [ ] Historical performance data

5. Space Usage and Quotas
   - [ ] Space usage visualization
   - [ ] Quota monitoring
   - [ ] Reservation tracking
   - [ ] Compression ratios

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code
- Docker
- VS Code Remote - Containers extension

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/petecog/vizfsulizer.git
cd vizfsulizer
```

2. Open in VS Code:

```bash
code .
```

3. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" or run the "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container" command.

### Development Environment

The project uses a Dev Container that provides:

- Go 1.21 development environment
- ZFS utilities
- Simulated ZFS pools and datasets for testing
- Required VS Code extensions

### Project Structure

```
vizfsulizer/
├── cmd/                         # Executable entry points
│   └── vizfsulizer/             # Main CLI application
│       └── main.go              # Just wires everything together
├── internal/                    # Private application code

│   └── utils/                   # Shared internal utilities
└── pkg/                         # (Future) Public API if needed
```

The project follows standard Go layout conventions:

- `cmd/`: Contains the executable entry points. Each subdirectory is a separate program.
  Keep these minimal - they should only wire together code from other packages.

- `internal/`: Contains private implementation code that cannot be imported by other projects.
  This is where most of our business logic lives.
  - `tui/`: Terminal UI implementation using Bubble Tea
  - `zfs/`: Core ZFS operations and data structures
  - `utils/`: Shared utilities used across the application

## Testing

The development container includes a simulated ZFS environment with:

- Two test pools (testpool and datapool)
- Various datasets with different properties
- Test snapshots
- Simulated data

To verify the test environment:

```bash
sudo zpool status
sudo zfs list
sudo zfs list -t snapshot
```

## Building

```bash
go build ./cmd/vizfsulizer
```
